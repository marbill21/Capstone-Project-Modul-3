## Business Problem Understanding
### Context

At present, cars have become one of the primary necessities for urban communities with high mobility. Cars can provide a sense of security, comfort, and time savings for their users, especially when there is inadequate public transportation. In meeting this need, consumers are not only interested in purchasing new cars but also many are interested in buying used cars. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, there is a platform for buying and selling used cars called Syarah.com. On this platform, consumers can search for their dream used cars at prices lower than buying new cars. On average, the condition of each used car being sold is also in good condition, and the depreciation in price tends to be not as high as with new cars. Syarah.com, as a platform providing used car buying and selling services, aims for consumers to have the best experience when transacting to buy used cars. Therefore, Syarah.com has hired a Data Scientist to assist them in creating a business model that can predict the prices of used cars and be mutually beneficial for both buyers and sellers.

The dataset consists of 5624 pieces of data about used cars collected from Syarah.com. Each row represents a used car. Other information representing each car includes the car's name, model, year of manufacture, origin of the car, equipment options, engine capacity, type of transmission, mileage of the car, price by region, and whether the price of the car is negotiable. <br>

### Problem Statement
The challenge faced by Syarah.com is to determine a business model that can be financially beneficial for the company in selling used cars, while also providing a good experience for potential buyers to obtain usable used cars at reasonable prices.

### Goals
Establishing a business model that can predict and assist potential buyers in obtaining a fair price for each used car they intend to purchase, while also benefiting the seller of the used car, namely Syarah.com.

### Analytic Approach
Conducting data analysis to discover patterns within the existing features that can distinguish one type of car from another. Subsequently, creating a regression model that can assist the company in predicting an accurate selling price, while also being beneficial for potential buyers to obtain a reasonable price for the used cars they intend to purchase in Saudi Arabia.

### Metric Evaluation
The evaluation metrics that will be used in building this machine learning model are:
- R-Square: Explains how much of the variation in Y values can be explained by the model.
- RMSE: The root mean square value of errors.
- MAE: The mean absolute value of errors.
- MAPE: The mean percentage error generated by a regression model.

The model will become more accurate in predicting the price of a used car according to the limitations of the features used, as the R-Square value approaches 1 and the values of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE become smaller.

## Data Understanding
- The dataset originates from a list of used cars sold in Saudi Arabia through syarah.com.
- Information and specifications about the cars sold on syarah.com are represented by each data row.

**Attributes Information**

| **Attribute** | **Data Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type | Object | Type of used cars. |
| Region | Object | Regions where used cars are offered for sale. |
| Make | Object | Name of the company that manufactures used cars. |
| Gear_Type | Object | Type of transmission used in used cars (Automatic / Manual). |
| Origin | Object | Origin of used cars (Saudi / Gulf Arabic / Other). |
| Options | Object | Options and features of used cars (Full / Semi-Full / Standard). |
| Year | Integer | Year of production of used cars. |
| Engine_Size | Float | Engine capacity of used cars. |
| Mileage | Integer | Mileage of used cars. |
| Negotiable | Boolean | Correct, if the price is 0, it means that the price of the used car is negotiable. |
| Price | Integer | Price of the used car. |

The Price attribute is the target column to be predicted (dependent variable), and the other columns are factors that will influence the prediction outcome. (Independent Variable).

## Conclusion

Here are some conclusions that can be drawn from the overall model development:

- Features 'Year' and 'Engine_Size' have a positive correlation with the target feature 'Price', while the 'Mileage' feature has a negative correlation. Among the categorical features, the 'Type' feature has the best ratio correlation with the target feature 'Price' compared to other categorical features.
- There are several limitations set in building this model, namely:

    1. Eliminating rows with duplicate data, totaling 4 occurrences, and rows with data values equal to 0 and 1 in the 'Price' feature, totaling 1796 and 1 occurrence respectively. These data points need to be removed to ensure that the model being built can predict using real prices and achieve accurate prediction results. However, this reduction in data observations leads to a significant decrease in the dataset size.
    2. For prediction, the model uses 'Year' feature data with values less than or equal to the year 2025.
    3. For prediction, the model uses 'Engine_Size' feature data with values less than or equal to 7.
    4. For prediction, the model uses 'Mileage' feature data with values less than 385,500 km.
    5. For prediction, the model uses 'Price' feature data with values less than or equal to 183,750 Saudi Riyal (SAR).
   
- The evaluation metrics used in the model development are R-square, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
- The R-square value indicates how much influence the features (independent variables) have on the target (dependent variable) overall. If we look at the R-square value generated by the XGBoost model after the hyperparameter tuning process, it is higher compared to the XGBoost model before the hyperparameter tuning process. The R-square value is 0.632565, which means that the features can explain 63.25% of the overall model.
- The RMSE value after the hyperparameter tuning process is 23757.04, which means that the built model for predicting the price of used cars within the price range of 0 to 183750 SAR will, on average, deviate by about 23757.04 from the actual price.
- These predicted prices could deviate even further, considering the large values of MAE and MAPE before the hyperparameter tuning process. Fortunately, the RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values of the model decreased after the hyperparameter tuning process. This indicates that the process successfully improved the model's performance and led to better predictions.

## Recommendation

Here are some recommendations that can be provided from the model development in order to achieve better predictions:

- After the elimination process, which involved removing rows with values of 0 and 1 SAR in the 'Price' feature, setting value constraints on the 'Year', 'Engine_Size', 'Mileage', and 'Price' features due to outliers, the number of data observations used for model development is reduced to 3,408 rows, or about 40% of the initial dataframe's size. Therefore, for future model development, it is advisable to increase the number of data rows to be used, in order to achieve more accurate predictions. The current dataset used for model development is quite small to provide optimal prediction results.
- Adding additional features that have a strong correlation with the target feature 'Price'. Such features could include car color, interior and exterior condition, document completeness (vehicle registration, license, and owner's manual), maintenance history, and accident history. (Source: [What are the factors that influence a used car price?](https://carsellzone.com/blog/detail/factors-affect-car-price))
- Adding a feature that can differentiate between classic cars and regular everyday cars. This is because the correlation between the 'Mileage' feature and the 'Price' target varies between classic cars and regular cars. For example, classic cars produced in 1970 may tend to be more expensive than cars produced in 2005. However, to classify such cars, domain knowledge about which car types can be categorized as classic cars is required.
